These things are the same as in emacs:
------------------------------------------
Backspace --- delete previous character
CTRL-d --- delete next character
CTRL-k --- delete rest of line
CTRL-a --- go to start of line
CTRL-e --- go to end of line
CTRL-b --- go backwards without deleting
CTRL-f --- go forward without deleting
---------------------------------------------
Other useful things
----------------------
TAB --- complete filename or command up to the point of uniqueness
CTRL-u --- cancel whole line
CTRL-p --- show the last command typed, then the one before that, etc.
(you can also use the cursor up key for this)
CTRL-n --- go forwards in the history of commands
(you can also use the cursor down key for this)
CTRL-c --- cancel the processes after it has started
CTRL-z --- suspend a running process (e.g. in order to do something else in between)
you can then put the process in the background with bg
CTRL-l --- redraws the screen

Hiera is a built-in key-value configuration data lookup system, used for separating data from Puppet code.

About Hiera
============
Puppet’s strength is in reusable code. Code that serves many needs must be configurable: put site-specific information in external configuration data files, rather than in the code itself.


Puppet uses Hiera to do two things:
-----------------------------------

Store the configuration data in key-value pairs

Look up what data a particular module needs for a given node during catalog compilation

This is done via:
-----------------
Automatic Parameter Lookup for classes included in the catalog

Explicit lookup calls
